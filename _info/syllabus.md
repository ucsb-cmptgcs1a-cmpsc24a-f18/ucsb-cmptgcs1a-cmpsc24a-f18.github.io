# About the Course

## Course Description:

This course is the first half of a two quarter sequence (CMPTGCS 1A, CMPTGCS 1B) designed to prepare students to take upper division courses in Computing, and participate in undergraduate research projects in Computing under the direction of CCS and College of Engineering Computing faculty.

In both quarters, the course is paired with CMPTGCS 1L, "Programming Lab", where students undertake individual and group programming projects to build and reinforce their skills and knowledge.

1A provides students with the opportunity to build skills and knowledge in the following areas: problem solving and algorithm development, C and C++ programming, software development tools, programming language paradigms (structured, functional and object-oriented programming), basic UNIX utilities and tools, basic data structures including arrays and linked lists representations of lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees, binary and linear search, sorting techniques, iteration vs. recursion, basic running time analysis, data representation.

In addition to basic skills in C and C++ (which is a fundamental preparation for upper division CS courses at UCSB), other programming languages such as Java, Scheme, Python, JavaScript and others may be explored either because of the principles they illustrate, or based on student interest.
